      <h2>Entry 1: Identifying Science–Art Practices</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
        This activity was part of Identifying Science–Art Practices, where we were asked to choose a keyword discussed in class and explore how it could highlight an area of improvement within scientific practice. 
        Using materials and collaborative making, we created a small art piece that translates an abstract concept into a physical form. Our chosen keyword was "Communication".
      </p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        For this first activity, my group chose the keyword communication, as it felt as a good connection of both science and art, and also one of the most fragile points within scientific practice. 
        We approached the assignment by building a physical structure that visually represents how communication in science can easily break down, yet still has the potential to connect distant points. 
        Using straws, connectors, wires, and unstable joints allowed us to make our interpretation visible rather than simply describing it.
<br><br>
        One of the main constraints we faced was structural instability. The materials were lightweight and not designed for precision, which made the overall construction of the piece a bit crooked and highlights its imperfections. 
        Instead of trying to eliminate this instability, we embraced it as part of the concept. The frequent collapses and adjustments became metaphors for miscommunication, data loss, or misunderstanding in scientific contexts. 
        These small “failures” forced us to slow down, negotiate decisions as a group, and rethink how each element depended on the others.
<br><br>
        Our choice of materials was intentional: the straws act as pathways for information, while the connectors represent translation points where meaning can either be lost in translation or arrive to its destination intact as in science.
        The wires extending outward suggest how communication can travel beyond its original source, but only if the internal structure holds. This process raised questions for me about how scientific communication could be made more resilient. 
        How can systems be designed to anticipate failure rather than deny it? How might visual or material thinking help scientists better communicate uncertainty, complexity, or risk?

      <h2>Entry 2: Science–Art as a Social Critique. Theater of the Oppressed</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
        This activity was part of Science–Art as a Social Critique and was based on Augusto Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed. 
        Through warm-up exercises, a Forum Theatre performance, and group intervention, we explored how critique can be practiced through participation rather than observation.
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>For this activity, our group worked with the theme of biometric surveillance and privacy, using Theatre of the Oppressed as a way to understand how these technologies affect people in everyday situations. 
        We chose to represent it through a nightclub scenario because it’s a familiar space where people expect freedom, fun, and inclusion. 
        Turning it into a place of surveillance made the impact of facial recognition feel more immediate and personal.
        <br><br>
        In our performance, people trying to enter the club were scanned and identified through a database, and their treatment depended entirely on what their digital file showed. 
        Some were allowed in, while others were rejected, judged, or treated poorly without explanation. Acting this out made it clear how little control individuals have once they are reduced to data. 
        Even though the setting was fictional, the reactions felt real, especially the discomfort of being excluded for reasons you can’t see or challenge.
        One challenge we faced was how quickly the scene could start to feel “normal.” This became an important realization rather than a failure. 
        It showed how easily discriminatory systems can be accepted when they are framed as automated, neutral, or efficient. 
        Theatre of the Oppressed pushed us to interrupt this normality and question the system instead of the individuals affected by it.
        <br><br>
        This activity made me think more critically about who designs surveillance technologies and who they actually serve. 
        It also showed me how performance can be a powerful way to expose hidden power structures and invite people to reflect on their own role as observers or participants. 
        Moving forward, I’m interested in exploring art practices that use interaction and embodiment to question technology, especially in spaces where control is disguised as convenience or security.

      <h2>Entry 3: De-jargonize & conceptualize science using divergent practices</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
       This workshop focused on de-jargonizing and conceptualizing science through divergent artistic practices. 
       Using a scientific research article, we explored how complex knowledge can be translated into emotional, material, and experiential forms that are more accessible to a non-specialized audience.
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>For this activity, we worked with a scientific paper about a brain–spine interface designed to improve gait after spinal cord injury. 
        At first, the text felt dense and distant, full of technical language that made it difficult to emotionally connect with the subject, even though the research itself was deeply human. 
        After having read the paper and understand key ideas, we started by translating the science into metaphors, similes, and keywords that could be more easily understood and broken down based on keywords.
        As a group, we focused on extracting words and ideas related to connection, interruption, flow, and repair. 
        Turning these abstract scientific concepts into metaphors helped shift the focus from data to experience. 
        Instead of thinking only about neurons and interfaces, we started thinking about movement, trust between body and machine, and the feeling of regaining control. 
        This process made the science feel less intimidating and more relatable.
        <br><br>
        There were moments where our metaphors felt unclear or incomplete, but these “failures” helped us understand where communication can easily break down. 
        They showed that the problem isn’t the science itself, but how it is usually communicated. Avoiding emotion doesn’t remove bias, it often removes meaning.
        We connected everything to communication and decided to move forward with this word which though encapsulated perfectly what we got from the paper. 
        <br><br>
        This activity made me realize how powerful artistic tools can be in building trust and understanding around scientific knowledge. 
        Moving forward, this approach inspires me to think about future projects where materials, metaphors, and sensory experiences help you translate complicated concepts into more digestable context which can reach people in a more human way.

      <h2>Continuation of class: Materiality – Metaphor – Convergency (Project)</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
       This project continued our exploration of materiality, metaphor, and convergency. Building from earlier exercises on de-jargonizing science, we worked on constructing extended metaphors by extracting keywords from scientific concepts and translating them into materials and written form.

      <h2>Continuation of class: Materiality – Metaphor – Convergency (Project)</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
       This project continued our exploration of materiality, metaphor, and convergency. Building from earlier exercises on de-jargonizing science, we worked on constructing extended metaphors by extracting keywords from scientific concepts and translating them into materials and written form. 
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>For this project, I developed an extended metaphor titled “The Red Rope.” The goal was to take abstract ideas about communication and turn them into something emotional, and relatable. Connect the term into a material, how con it be represented through emotions and a physical concept. 
        Instead of explaining these concepts directly, I wanted the material and the metaphor to speak on their own.
        I chose the image of a rope because it naturally suggests connection and tension. Making it red felt essential as red demands attention.
        It signals urgency, warning, intimacy, and vulnerability all at once. Through the metaphor, the rope becomes something that connects people, carries meaning, and refuses to disappear once it exists. Like communication, it can bind or divide just as clarify or confuse.
        <br><br>
        One of the main challenges was sustaining a metaphor without it becoming repetitive or too literal. At times, the writing felt like it was slipping into explanation rather than experience
        I realized that not everything needs to be clarified for it to be understood. Ambiguity allows the viewer or reader to enter the work with their own associations, which mirrors how communication functions in real life.
        This process made me think more deeply about how meaning travels; how messages change weight, texture, and impact depending on multiple factors usually outside of our control. It reinforced the idea that communication is never neutral or clean. It leaves traces no matter the consequences.
        <br><br>  
        It also made me more interested in using metaphor as a bridge between scientific ideas and lived experience, allowing complexity to exist without relying on jargon.
