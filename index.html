      <h2>Entry 1: Identifying Science–Art Practices</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
        This activity was part of Identifying Science–Art Practices, where we were asked to choose a keyword discussed in class and explore how it could highlight an area of improvement within scientific practice. 
        Using materials and collaborative making, we created a small art piece that translates an abstract concept into a physical form. Our chosen keyword was "Communication".
      </p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        For this first activity, my group chose the keyword communication, as it felt as a good connection of both science and art, and also one of the most fragile points within scientific practice. 
        We approached the assignment by building a physical structure that visually represents how communication in science can easily break down, yet still has the potential to connect distant points. 
        Using straws, connectors, wires, and unstable joints allowed us to make our interpretation visible rather than simply describing it.
<br><br>
        One of the main constraints we faced was structural instability. The materials were lightweight and not designed for precision, which made the overall construction of the piece a bit crooked and highlights its imperfections. 
        Instead of trying to eliminate this instability, we embraced it as part of the concept. The frequent collapses and adjustments became metaphors for miscommunication, data loss, or misunderstanding in scientific contexts. 
        These small “failures” forced us to slow down, negotiate decisions as a group, and rethink how each element depended on the others.
<br><br>
        Our choice of materials was intentional: the straws act as pathways for information, while the connectors represent translation points where meaning can either be lost in translation or arrive to its destination intact as in science.
        The wires extending outward suggest how communication can travel beyond its original source, but only if the internal structure holds. This process raised questions for me about how scientific communication could be made more resilient. 
        How can systems be designed to anticipate failure rather than deny it? How might visual or material thinking help scientists better communicate uncertainty, complexity, or risk?

      <h2>Entry 2: Science–Art as a Social Critique. Theater of the Oppressed</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
        This activity was part of Science–Art as a Social Critique and was based on Augusto Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed. 
        Through warm-up exercises, a Forum Theatre performance, and group intervention, we explored how critique can be practiced through participation rather than observation.
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>For this activity, our group worked with the theme of biometric surveillance and privacy, using Theatre of the Oppressed as a way to understand how these technologies affect people in everyday situations. 
        We chose to represent it through a nightclub scenario because it’s a familiar space where people expect freedom, fun, and inclusion. 
        Turning it into a place of surveillance made the impact of facial recognition feel more immediate and personal.
        <br><br>
        In our performance, people trying to enter the club were scanned and identified through a database, and their treatment depended entirely on what their digital file showed. 
        Some were allowed in, while others were rejected, judged, or treated poorly without explanation. Acting this out made it clear how little control individuals have once they are reduced to data. 
        Even though the setting was fictional, the reactions felt real, especially the discomfort of being excluded for reasons you can’t see or challenge.
        One challenge we faced was how quickly the scene could start to feel “normal.” This became an important realization rather than a failure. 
        It showed how easily discriminatory systems can be accepted when they are framed as automated, neutral, or efficient. 
        Theatre of the Oppressed pushed us to interrupt this normality and question the system instead of the individuals affected by it.
        <br><br>
        This activity made me think more critically about who designs surveillance technologies and who they actually serve. 
        It also showed me how performance can be a powerful way to expose hidden power structures and invite people to reflect on their own role as observers or participants. 
        Moving forward, I’m interested in exploring art practices that use interaction and embodiment to question technology, especially in spaces where control is disguised as convenience or security.

      <h2>Entry 3: De-jargonize & conceptualize science using divergent practices</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
       This workshop focused on de-jargonizing and conceptualizing science through divergent artistic practices. 
       Using a scientific research article, we explored how complex knowledge can be translated into emotional, material, and experiential forms that are more accessible to a non-specialized audience.
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>For this activity, we worked with a scientific paper about a brain–spine interface designed to improve gait after spinal cord injury. 
        At first, the text felt dense and distant, full of technical language that made it difficult to emotionally connect with the subject, even though the research itself was deeply human. 
        After having read the paper and understand key ideas, we started by translating the science into metaphors, similes, and keywords that could be more easily understood and broken down based on keywords.
        As a group, we focused on extracting words and ideas related to connection, interruption, flow, and repair. 
        Turning these abstract scientific concepts into metaphors helped shift the focus from data to experience. 
        Instead of thinking only about neurons and interfaces, we started thinking about movement, trust between body and machine, and the feeling of regaining control. 
        This process made the science feel less intimidating and more relatable.
        <br><br>
        There were moments where our metaphors felt unclear or incomplete, but these “failures” helped us understand where communication can easily break down. 
        They showed that the problem isn’t the science itself, but how it is usually communicated. Avoiding emotion doesn’t remove bias, it often removes meaning.
        We connected everything to communication and decided to move forward with this word which though encapsulated perfectly what we got from the paper. 
        <br><br>
        This activity made me realize how powerful artistic tools can be in building trust and understanding around scientific knowledge. 
        Moving forward, this approach inspires me to think about future projects where materials, metaphors, and sensory experiences help you translate complicated concepts into more digestable context which can reach people in a more human way.

      <h2>Continuation of class: Materiality – Metaphor – Convergency (Project)</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
       This project continued our exploration of materiality, metaphor, and convergency. Building from earlier exercises on de-jargonizing science, we worked on constructing extended metaphors by extracting keywords from scientific concepts and translating them into materials and written form. 
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>For this project, I developed an extended metaphor titled “The Red Rope.” The goal was to take abstract ideas about communication and turn them into something emotional, and relatable. Connect the term into a material, how con it be represented through emotions and a physical concept. 
        Instead of explaining these concepts directly, I wanted the material and the metaphor to speak on their own.
        I chose the image of a rope because it naturally suggests connection and tension. Making it red felt essential as red demands attention.
        It signals urgency, warning, intimacy, and vulnerability all at once. Through the metaphor, the rope becomes something that connects people, carries meaning, and refuses to disappear once it exists. Like communication, it can bind or divide just as clarify or confuse.
        <br><br>
        One of the main challenges was sustaining a metaphor without it becoming repetitive or too literal. At times, the writing felt like it was slipping into explanation rather than experience
        I realized that not everything needs to be clarified for it to be understood. Ambiguity allows the viewer or reader to enter the work with their own associations, which mirrors how communication functions in real life.
        This process made me think more deeply about how meaning travels; how messages change weight, texture, and impact depending on multiple factors usually outside of our control. It reinforced the idea that communication is never neutral or clean. It leaves traces no matter the consequences.
        <br><br>  
        It also made me more interested in using metaphor as a bridge between scientific ideas and lived experience, allowing complexity to exist without relying on jargon.

      <h2>Entry 5: Cinematic Presentations</h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
       For this class, each student prepared a short cinematic presentation to introduce their practice and one or two key areas of interest. The goal was not to present a portfolio, but to clearly communicate what drives our work and how we position ourselves as artists or scientists. 
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
      For this assignment, I created a three-minute video that focused on my artistic practice and the intentions behind it. 
      Instead of listing projects, I wanted to communicate why I make the work I do, what questions I’m drawn to, and how my interests shape my creative process. 
      The time limit forced me to be selective and intentional about what I shared, which was challenging but helpful. I did in fact put my work as the background pieces which resulted in a very portfolio like experience but the main intentions were the words being said and my intention im py practice. 
      <br><br>
      What stood out to me most during this class was watching everyone else’s presentations. Even when people had similar backgrounds or overlapping interests, each practice felt clearly distinct. 
      It was a reminder that uniqueness doesn’t come from having a rare discipline, but from how each person connects ideas, experiences, and questions in their own way.
      <br><br>
      I was especially interested in the presentations from students with neuroscience backgrounds. Seeing how easily they explained complex concepts made me think differently about communication and accessibility. It showed how clarity doesn’t mean simplifying ideas to the point of losing depth, but finding ways to make them understandable and engaging.
      I feel that this connects with my interpretation of my practice as I focus on making invisible systems visible and digestible for people.
      This experience reinforced the importance of being able to articulate my practice clearly, not just through finished work, but through storytelling and intention.

      <h2>Entry 6: Visual Acuity, Colour, and Gestalt </h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
       This class focused on visual acuity, colour perception, and Gestalt principles. Through a structured painting exercise, we experimented with visual distortion by observing an image indirectly and translating perception into colour using grids and controlled viewing conditions.
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
      This exercise pushed me to slow down and really pay attention to how I see, rather than what I think I see. By observing the image either directly or slightly off-focus and then translating that perception into colour, I realized how unstable and subjective colour actually is. What I expected to perceive was often very different from what my eyes registered at a slight distance or angle.
      I also noticed it when comparing my work to others. Even when we were all looking at the same image, the colours and forms we produced varied widely based on our individual perceptions and interpretations.
      <br><br>
      Working with the grid made the process feel both systematic and experimental. Each square became its own moment of decision, forcing me to trust perception instead of relying on memory or logic. Mixing colours without staring directly at them was especially challenging. It felt counterintuitive, but it revealed how vision fills in gaps and smooths information automatically, something we rarely notice in everyday viewing.
      <br><br>
      This activity was very inspiring because it made Gestalt principles feel embodied rather than theoretical. It gave me ideas for future work that explores perception, abstraction, and visual uncertainty, especially projects where the process of seeing becomes just as important as the image itself.

      <h2>Entry 7: Smash and Rules for Abstraction.  </h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
      This class focused on Smash and Rules for Abstraction, where we explored reactions to the destruction of something we had invested time and effort into. 
      The exercise aimed to expose the emotional relationship between creation, control, and loss within artistic practice.
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
      This class made me think deeply about the connection between stress and art. 
      Watching the destruction of something that required time and care immediately brought up feelings of pressure, stress and resistance. 
      It became clear that stress isn’t just a side effect of making art but it’s often built into the process from the very beginning.
      <br><br>
      In my written reflection, I focused on how stress appears at every stage of creation: the pressure to start with a good idea, the anxiety of making the “right” decisions, and the fear of ruining something as it takes form. 
      Seeing the work destroyed forced me to confront how much value I place on the final object rather than the experience of making it. The discomfort was real, but it was also revealing.
      What stood out to me most was how destruction didn’t erase the work, but transformed it. The emotional response became part of the artwork itself. 
      <br><br>
      This challenged my understanding of success, failure, and completion in art-making. Letting go of control felt stressful, but it also opened space for reflection and acceptance.

      <h2>Entry 8: Uncanny valleys, sadness and horror as aesthetic experience </h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
      This class explored uncanny valleys, sadness, and horror as aesthetic experiences. 
      Through discussion and mask-making, we examined how emotions often considered negative, such as sadness, fear, and discomfort, can become meaningful and even beneficial when experienced through art.
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
      For this activity, I created a mask inspired by La Catrina, using it as a way to explore sadness from a place of safety rather than threat. I based my mask on memories of my grandfather, who used to call me his palomita—his little pigeon. Including this symbol allowed the process to feel personal, gentle, and grounded in love rather than loss alone.
      <br><br>
      Working through the mask made me think differently about sadness. Instead of something to avoid, it became something to sit with and translate visually. The act of creating was slow and reflective, and it helped me reconnect with memories that are still emotional but no longer overwhelming. Using the Catrina as a reference made space for both grief and celebration, honoring life while acknowledging absence.
      <br><br>
      This experience helped me understand how art can support resilience and emotional regulation. It reminded me that sadness can coexist with beauty, and that remembering someone can be an act of connection rather than loss.

      <h2>Entry 9: Parallel Worlds – Curating Neuroscience in an Exhibition Space </h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
      This class focused on curating neuroscience concepts within an exhibition context. We discussed artworks connected to topics such as memory, emotion, visual systems, stress, and neuro-aesthetics, and explored how scientific ideas can be translated into curatorial and artistic decisions.
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
      This class helped me see how neuroscience concepts can exist beyond textbooks and experiments, and instead live within exhibition spaces and artistic experiences. Connecting ideas like memory, emotion, and stress to specific artworks made the science feel more tangible and intuitive. It showed how art can act as a bridge, allowing complex scientific concepts to be felt rather than just understood.
      <br><br>
      What I enjoyed most was seeing how differently everyone interpreted the same topics. Even when responding to similar concepts, each person’s curatorial choices reflected their own interests, experiences, and way of thinking. This made it clear that there is no single “correct” way to translate science into art, only thoughtful and intentional ones.
      <br><br>
      This activity also made me more aware of how exhibitions shape meaning. The way works are grouped, framed, or contextualized can completely change how a viewer understands both the art and the science behind it.
      Overall, this class reinforced my interest in working at the intersection of art and science. It gave me ideas for future projects that consider not just the artwork itself, but the space, narrative, and experience surrounding it as part of the communication process.

      <h2>Entry 10: Coding, Ciphering, and Steganography. Translating science elements into art. </h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
      This class explored coding, ciphering, and steganography as ways of translating scientific information into artistic form. Using genetic code as a starting point, we worked on transforming natural code into material and visual patterns to better understand the value of interdisciplinary research creation.
      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
      For this activity, I worked with the gene associated with curly hair, translating its sequence into a stitched, color-coded textile pattern. Taking something as abstract and microscopic as genetic code and turning it into a physical object made the science feel more tangible and personal. Stitching the sequence by hand slowed the process down and made me more aware of repetition, variation, and rhythm within the code.
      <br><br>
      Choosing felt and a color system based on the gene pattern allowed the information to remain structured while still leaving space for interpretation. What stood out to me most was how patterns emerged only once the code became material. Sequences that felt meaningless on a screen started to show visual logic and texture when translated into fabric. The artwork revealed information in a way the original code did not.
      <br><br>
      This activity reinforced the value of interdisciplinary practice. It showed how scientific data can be re-read through artistic processes, revealing new insights rather than simplifying the science.

      <h2>Entry 11:  </h2>
      
        <h3>Activity Context</h3>
      <p>
      This class focused on The Interviewer and the Doppelganger, using role-play, observation, and performance to explore discomfort and identity. 
      Through interviews and the creation of a doppelganger self-portrait, we examined how stepping into another person’s presence can open space for new ways of thinking.

      </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
      This activity pushed me outside my comfort zone in a very subtle but effective way. Interviewing a classmate and then becoming her doppelganger required a level of attention and empathy that felt different from most creative exercises. It wasn’t about copying someone, but about observing how they exist in the world.
      In my portrait, I painted myself while intentionally letting my partner’s presence shape the work. Physically, the painting reflects elements of her appearance, such as her light-colored eyes and overall softness.
      Conceptually, I wanted to include aspects of her background and interests like: her connection to a quiet, snowy town far from the city, and her interest in neuroscience, depression, and trauma. These elements drove the painting to the desired outcome. 
      <br><br>
      One of the challenges was holding both identities at once. The portrait is neither fully her nor fully me, and that tension felt uncomfortable but productive. It made me reflect on how identity is often relational, shaped by who we interact with and how we perceive others. The fact that the artwork is still in progress feels appropriate, as the process itself is ongoing and unresolved.
      <br><br>
      This exercise made me think about how empathy can be practiced through art, not just represented. It also showed how discomfort can lead to deeper understanding rather than distance.
